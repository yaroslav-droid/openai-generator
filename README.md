![Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=OpenAI+Key+Generator)

## Overview

Welcome to **OpenAI Key Generator**, a tool designed for testing the validity of OpenAI API keys with a variety of models. This script leverages advanced Python features and libraries to provide an interactive and detailed experience for analyzing API keys.

### Features

- 🛠 **Fake Key Generation**: Generates realistic, fake OpenAI API keys for testing purposes.
- ✅ **Key Validation**: Verifies the validity of keys against selected OpenAI models.
- 📊 **Error Analysis**: Tracks and categorizes errors encountered during the validation process.
- 🔄 **Dynamic Rate Calculation**: Displays real-time key validation speed.
- 🖥 **Interactive Model Selection**: Choose from a range of OpenAI models using an intuitive interface.
- 💾 **Clean Logging**: Logs events to a file (automatically cleaned up after execution).

## How It Works

1. **Fake Key Generation**: The script generates keys resembling real OpenAI API keys.
2. **Key Validation**: Each key is tested against the selected model using OpenAI's API.
3. **Error Handling**: Errors are captured, categorized, and analyzed for better insights.
4. **Logging**: Key validation events are logged, and progress is displayed in real-time.

## Future Improvements

- 🌟 **GUI Integration**: Add a graphical user interface for enhanced usability.
- 📈 **Performance Metrics**: Include more detailed statistics and visual charts.
- 🔒 **Real API Integration**: Extend support for real OpenAI API keys.
- 🌍 **Localization**: Support multiple languages for global accessibility.
